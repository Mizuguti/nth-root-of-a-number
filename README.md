# nth-root-of-a-number
It's not ideal by any means, I should have used that newton method but guess what? I didnt understand. So thats what I got for now. The code is unoptimal as fuck, it guesses every single number from 0 with two decimal units until it finds the answer.

Slow? maybe.

Works? yes.

I wouldnt really trust this for anything that requires more than two decimal units of precision, but you do you.
